## Laptop Price Predictor

This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive laptop price prediction project that demonstrates my proficiency in various aspects of data science and machine learning. Here's an overview of what you'll find:

### Data Preprocessing and Exploration
- The project starts with data preprocessing to clean and transform the dataset.
- It includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and feature engineering to create new meaningful features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dive into exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
- Visualize laptop brands, types, and CPU categories, and analyze their impact on laptop prices.

### Feature Engineering
- Extract valuable information from columns like 'ScreenResolution,' 'Memory,' 'CPU,' and 'GPU.'
- Create new features to enhance model performance.

### Model Building
- Implement multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and XGBoost.
- Utilize one-hot encoding to handle categorical variables.
- Evaluate model performance using R-squared and mean absolute error metrics.

### Data Transformation
- Apply Power Transformation to the target variable ('Price') for better model performance.

### Train-Test Split
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

This project serves as a practical example of how to tackle real-world data science challenges, from data preprocessing to model Building. Feel free to explore the code and reach out for any questions or collaboration opportunities!
